# automatic_emails
Sends a newsfeed about any subject to specified emails using NewsAPI.org. I plan to build out a customizable user interface with database functionality (ex."delete all articles from 'Hackernews.com' prior to sending the newsfeed email".)

This project is solving a real-world automation problem that I have with sending custom newsfeeds for work.
